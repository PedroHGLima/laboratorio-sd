<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="819" delta="new" >&quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">/home/ise/laboratorio-sd/alu/Selecao.vhd</arg>&quot; line <arg fmt="%d" index="2">182</arg>: One or more signals are missing in the process sensitivity list. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:

Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
